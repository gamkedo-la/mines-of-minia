# ux research techniques
use a recorder, rather than notes
- enable push to talk
- keep yourself on mute and talk into a recorder
- then otter it

# observations
- he uses both the arrows and the keys
	- but hey preferred the arrow keys
- he didn't seem to know that you can use scan to spot traps
	- died to a lot of traps
- he died quite a lot
	- cheifly to fuel deaths
- possible balance issue with the fuel
	- sometimes you spawn with a tank, but sometimes you don't
	- if you don't happen upon one, you are totally screwed
- he said that he felt slightly frustrated because he kept dying
	- at one point sighed audibly and chuckled 
		- "hmmmmm...this is hard"
	- attributed this to his ability 
		- says he's not much of a gamer
- when he was leveling up talents, he wanted to burn less fuel and not die
	- those *are* the obstacles
	- but it seems he's playing v defensively bc he feels he has to 

# frustrations
- felt as though the game is pretty hard
	- wasn't sure if it was his ability or the games difficulty
	- "even if i survive i keep running out of fuel"
- he was a little confused by the turn based movement. but it eventually made sense to him
- didn't know that he had to run into enemies to attack them, but he eventually figured that out.

# suggestions
- make fuel deaths less opaque
	- put the fuel tank icon to the left of the fuel gauge
	- perhaps have that gauge blink yellow and white @ 25%
- reduce possibility of fuel death suggestions
	- increase fuel drops
	- reduce/change the penalty
- show the player that i/t will open/close inventory/talents

# what he liked
- the visual armor, "it was cute"
- exploring and running around
	- "if there was no fuel limit, i would have kept exploring"
	- "i'm super directionless"
	- "i kept getting lost, i need to wander a lot to find my way"

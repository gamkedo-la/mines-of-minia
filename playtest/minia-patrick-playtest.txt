i think at this point, try to get to the tangible suggestions as quickly as you can 

# suggestions
- implement feedback for misses
- implement indication that player can move/attack diagonally

# bugs
- shrooms don't fire @ close range (8:35 for clip)
- "idk if me or performance but sometimes the movement is jumpy" (15:30)

# ux
- he noticed that if you use the mouse to move, you cannot cancel that movement 
- i'm moving it...i just wanna click it (9:05)
	- not sure what he's trying to accomplish here, or what the exact confusion is, but it does seem as if he's confused about how to interact with the menu
- he it unclear that he could use this ax that required 11 spry (bot starts with 10) and that it's just *more* effective if you have 11 spry. 
- he grabs some power pickups at an earlier point in his run and is unsure about what power is used for/how to use it
- equip/de-equip noise, feedback 
	- "no it's not gonna let me"
	- perhaps it generally seems unclear if the buttons are in fact doing something?
- was generally unclear about how stats get changed
	- tbh idk how they get upgraded either
	- at one point tries to experiment with changing weapons to see if that will change the stats
- seems unsure how to compare weapons
	- 13:00-13:15 "seems worse, but not really certain"
	- implement little arrows? discrete fields in the info box, rather than running copy?
- level up feedback could be more pronounced?
- unsure about...
	- what the suns are/do
	- how to identify weapons stats/how to know if a weapon has a charm or a curse applied to it 
	- i think the ui says "inspect to find out"
	- what the cost of scanning is 
		- ash: if there is no cost, is it more of an annoyance than anything else? idk
	- i wish i could hold the arrow key (esp when backtracking, traversing a lot of ground)
		- he tended to use the mouse to backtrack for this reason
- the fuel feature made it less likely for him to want to backtrack 
- the gold helmet blends in with the bot, doesn't look like anything is equiped 

# follow up q's
"how did you feel about the experience of scanning?"

he was confused about doors having key costs
- problem
	- i think he ran out of keys at one point and didn't know why
	- when he saw a south facing door, he grasped that it required a key
	- all the doors he saw up to that point were west/east facing, so he didn't 
	- additionally, he was able to figure out that the orange doors do not have a key cost
- solution
	- feedback that a key is being spent
	- i think link's awakening just shows a key hover for <1s in front of a locked door to indicate you just spent a key

# opacity
- wasn't sure how to attack/move on the diagonal
	- "[the enemies'] diagonal advantage is too strong"
- he was curious about what fuel was
	- eventually figures out that it is seperate from health but needs to be tended to "like stamina"
- he wasn't sure what the TNT does (i'm not either)
	- is that interactable?
- it's not immediately clear that leveling up increases your points to spent on talents

# game balance
- noticed he was struggling to find fuel
	- "i really need fuel, idk where to find it"
	- but when he found a vendor, the fuel was way too cheap
- is it too easy to camp in a doorway?
- i think certain items are supposed to come with curses as well, but he didn't seem to encounter anything with a negative effect
	- "i'll just assume they're all good"
- he collected < 100 gold from just wandering around, and sold old equipment for ~1000. was kinda taken aback by that.
- was saving gems till he was "in trouble"
	- the final fantasy elixer paradox

# 9:49pm is the starting point - let's keep this here. 

[[to be scrubbed to...]]


i wish i knew what some of the items were doing more
^ tool tips

# his comments at the end
- wishes there were hoverable tool tips on the items
- enjoyed the mystery aspect of the items
- at points couldn't figure out what certain items did after he equipped them
- "definitely fun"
- "i wanna know what all the things do"
- he enjoyed the movement as attack 
- he wondered how many levels there were, figured it would take some amount of time to clear the game

can i click to move
arrow keys?

9:49 about a minute in

trying to figure out what to do with TNT?

esc will back out of menu
and also back out of full screen 

wondering about the turn based progression
am i missing?
^ additional feedback 

is that what the scan does?
did i just hit a trap?

i'm getting whoomped
"can i go diagonal"
^ he can but he doesn't know that 

door baiting

curious about the tnt

same level same seed 
seems hard to clear the first stage
the diagonal advantage is too strong

"attacking first seems like the way to go"

9:54 
"talents...i didn't look at this before

how to heal?
what's the green plus?

the mushroom can shoot through walls...feels really really cheap

what is fuel?

"fuel is not health"

"i'm just gonna speed around for a bit"

a: are you using the mouse?
...he did start using the mouse

"can't cacel out of the mouse

^ noting displeasure 

shrooms can't fire close range?

9:57 what did i pick up?
i'm moving it...i just wanna click it

invuln cog

what is power?
9:59 do i have a power to use the power?

"ok i *can* use the ax...is it just more effective if I have the spry

10:00 what is a medium level of spry
^ is it cursed?

10:01 i'm level 2, when did that happen?
p is trying to see if changing weapons is changing his stats 

10:02
"how will i know what the charm is"

10:03 does scanning cost me anything?

10:04 if if me or perf...but sometimes the movement is jumpy

god, traps all over this room

a: do the keys work 

"i wish i could hold the arrow key"
like just hold and keep going

does leveling up increase your stats

"didn't know the enemies could hit that traps, that's awesome"

idk what the yellow bar is...
"i assume the yellow bar is the fuel bar"
"guess i'll have to find that often enough 

10:08
"now that i understand i have fuel...not sure i wanna go back"
"can i go back if i go up...gamer intuition is telling me no"

10:09
we broke the build
just refer back to this point, for error reporting

concrete stuff to give tylor

10:12 reloaded the page...and i got a new level
"i can learn the level if i just never reload"

helment
"now i can see myself whereing it...
maybe bc it was gold same color

"idk if the colored door signifies things...one asked me for a key
"i guess i used a key

"i was unware i used my key
"upright v sideways

idk if the orange doors take keys

"last level had them all horitzonal...so i didn't know"

10:17
"this is where i wanna hold to run, backtracking"
"so i use the mouse"

10:17
"i hope this is a trader"
wants to use his coins, hasn't seen a chance to do that yet

still hasn't figured out diagonal strike
is it too easy to just camp in a doorway?

10:19 clicking stat changes dmg red. 
^ is it just bc of the gadget?

"i really need fuel, idk where to find it"
"do i need to scan for fuel, or does scanning take fuel"

10:23 
"door to a dead end"


10:25
re: charms
"i'm just assume their all good

"idk what the tnt is about
"does it take more fuel to go through these vines?

"do seem to not be taking dmg from the spiders
^ is this armor very op

10:27

"then i have to click on the screen to get focused

is he just missing?
i think more feedback is needed

sound, something anything
"phew" - miss. 

10:28 "i have 92 money

meet with liz...ask her how to best process video and notes, etc 
the heck do i know

10:30
i can throw things?
"i'm gonna save the gems till i'm in trouble...idk what they do but i assume they're gonna help"

1031 "is that a gun??
discovers the quick slot
"ah now i'm using the blue bar

10:32 performance is taking a hit

10:33 oh god it's really bad here 
is this what he's selling?

- woah...massive goal for sells
^ it seems kinda imba...
but that could be a valid thing idk

why haven't i equipped this reactor?

1035 the rector didn't look like an icon 

10:36
he's takin all the fuel
fuel is v cheap...yeah there are balance issues here 

switched over a bit to do some soundtrack
i think he went upstairs
i he thinks his health is bugged

oh the level up seems to be upgrading the talents
- he kinda forgot about it
idk how much of this is usability problems v...
it's an interface he needs to learn 

shield is bugged too?

he's very proactive. it's nice ^_^

"this feels like a good stopping point"

can slow it down by scanning spam 

scan lag (@ end of second tape)

attacking without a weapon breaks the game

"the snappiness of the movement bothers me
it doesn't feel linear"
something about the camera 
it's not a smooth stop a little jerky at the end

i wish i knew what some of the items were doing more
^ tool tips

i like the myster aspect of the items

you discover it over time
he's aware of what the items are generally
and the mystery intention
but "it would take few items"

"couldn't figure out what they were doing after i equipement"

"definitely fun"
"i wanna know what all the things do"
likes the movement as attack 

"i do wonder how many levels there are...do take some time"

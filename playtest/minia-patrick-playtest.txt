# ux considerations

- implement feedback for missed player attacks
- implement indication that player can move/attack diagonally
	- 3:40 

going to leave some general notes up here. maybe i will also grab some exact time stamps when it becomes relevant. perhaps only if i intend to make a card

- he noticed that the level will remain the same unless the page is reloaded
	- "i can learn the level if i never reload"
- he was curious about what fuel was, but eventually figures it out. understands that it is seperate from health

time stamps are pretty rough.
went by the time on the clock, and converted them after the fact. 
sorry about that x_x

gonna turn this into a rough transcription to start
and then go back for exact quotes as needs
unless noted like so

> quote

quote marks likely denote a paraphrased sentance 

# 0:00

"can i click to move?"
"can i use the arrow keys?"

# +1:00 (starting at 9:49pm)
pat wonders about the TNT, if he can interact with it

# 3:40 pat muses about the "diagonal advantage" the enemies have
- at one point he says "the diagonal advantage is too strong"

he strat for proceeding thus far has been to bait enemies to the door where he can square up with them one by one
- is it too easy for the player to just camp in the doorway?

# 5:23 "talents...i didn't look at this before"

he wonders how to heal, but eventually notices the green pluses that pop up over the bot as it walks around. decides to "speed around a bit" after taking quite a beating

# 6:12 - 6:27 the mushroom can shoot through walls and doors, feels cheap




# bugs
- shrooms don't fire @ close range (8:35 for clip)
- "idk if me or performance but sometimes the movement is jumpy" (15:30)

# ux
- he noticed that if you use the mouse to move, you cannot cancel that movement 
- i'm moving it...i just wanna click it (9:05)
	- not sure what he's trying to accomplish here, or what the exact confusion is, but it does seem as if he's confused about how to interact with the menu
- he it unclear that he could use this ax that required 11 spry (bot starts with 10) and that it's just *more* effective if you have 11 spry. 
- he grabs some power pickups at an earlier point in his run and is unsure about what power is used for/how to use it
- equip/de-equip noise, feedback 
	- "no it's not gonna let me"
	- perhaps it generally seems unclear if the buttons are in fact doing something?
- was generally unclear about how stats get changed
	- tbh idk how they get upgraded either
	- at one point tries to experiment with changing weapons to see if that will change the stats
- seems unsure how to compare weapons
	- 13:00-13:15 "seems worse, but not really certain"
	- implement little arrows? discrete fields in the info box, rather than running copy?
- level up feedback could be more pronounced?
- unsure about...
	- what the suns are/do
	- how to identify weapons stats/how to know if a weapon has a charm or a curse applied to it 
	- i think the ui says "inspect to find out"
	- what the cost of scanning is 
		- ash: if there is no cost, is it more of an annoyance than anything else? idk
	- i wish i could hold the arrow key (esp when backtracking, traversing a lot of ground)
		- he tended to use the mouse to backtrack for this reason
- the fuel feature made it less likely for him to want to backtrack 
- the gold helmet blends in with the bot, doesn't look like anything is equiped 

# follow up q's
"how did you feel about the experience of scanning?"

he was confused about doors having key costs
- problem
	- i think he ran out of keys at one point and didn't know why
	- when he saw a south facing door, he grasped that it required a key
	- all the doors he saw up to that point were west/east facing, so he didn't 
	- additionally, he was able to figure out that the orange doors do not have a key cost
- solution
	- feedback that a key is being spent
	- i think link's awakening just shows a key hover for <1s in front of a locked door to indicate you just spent a key


still hasn't figured out diagonal strike
is it too easy to just camp in a doorway?

10:19 clicking stat changes dmg red. 
^ is it just bc of the gadget?

"i really need fuel, idk where to find it"
"do i need to scan for fuel, or does scanning take fuel"

10:23 
"door to a dead end"


10:25
re: charms
"i'm just assume their all good

"idk what the tnt is about
"does it take more fuel to go through these vines?

"do seem to not be taking dmg from the spiders
^ is this armor very op

10:27

"then i have to click on the screen to get focused

is he just missing?
i think more feedback is needed

sound, something anything
"phew" - miss. 

10:28 "i have 92 money

meet with liz...ask her how to best process video and notes, etc 
the heck do i know

10:30
i can throw things?
"i'm gonna save the gems till i'm in trouble...idk what they do but i assume they're gonna help"

1031 "is that a gun??
discovers the quick slot
"ah now i'm using the blue bar

10:32 performance is taking a hit

10:33 oh god it's really bad here 
is this what he's selling?

- woah...massive goal for sells
^ it seems kinda imba...
but that could be a valid thing idk

why haven't i equipped this reactor?

1035 the rector didn't look like an icon 

10:36
he's takin all the fuel
fuel is v cheap...yeah there are balance issues here 

switched over a bit to do some soundtrack
i think he went upstairs
i he thinks his health is bugged

oh the level up seems to be upgrading the talents
- he kinda forgot about it
idk how much of this is usability problems v...
it's an interface he needs to learn 

shield is bugged too?

he's very proactive. it's nice ^_^

"this feels like a good stopping point"

can slow it down by scanning spam 

scan lag (@ end of second tape)

attacking without a weapon breaks the game

"the snappiness of the movement bothers me
it doesn't feel linear"
something about the camera 
it's not a smooth stop a little jerky at the end

i wish i knew what some of the items were doing more
^ tool tips

i like the myster aspect of the items

you discover it over time
he's aware of what the items are generally
and the mystery intention
but "it would take few items"

"couldn't figure out what they were doing after i equipement"

"definitely fun"
"i wanna know what all the things do"
likes the movement as attack 

"i do wonder how many levels there are...do take some time"

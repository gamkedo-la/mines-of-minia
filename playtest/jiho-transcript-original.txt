starts moving immediately

seeing that close range bug...
maybe not a bug

combo mouse/arrow key usage

he seems to have rebalanced the health oh maybe not

3:56 what is this?

4:44 goes right instead

i don't think he's using the scan 
dies to trap 

maybe the player could figure out a run that would level them up, 
and allow them to progress

ala franken 

7:25~ notcied diagonal movement 
also it seems like "you notcied something" will happen if close to a trap
scan is not required per se?

8:45 what did you just do?

2x deaths 
i wonder if he can actually progress

he keeps trying different ways though. 
i'm not getting a great sense of 

9:40 - opens talents for first time 

11:25 i think he's figured out what the traps are

oh maybe record to transcript?
keep yourself on mute and talk into a recorder?
then otter it?

he's gonna die off a fuel death

there's no real indicator

14:10 perhaps a message or a flashing bar?

or no death, idk, maybe it's broken 
that's a bug too. 
ooooooo
it's just -1

15:21 - weird teleport bug

ok he sees that it's yellow
ok so he does know 

so sometimes i think you spawn with a fuel cell...
but sometimes not

and i haven't seen a drop of one

yeah this is a balance issue

something needs to be done to like either
drop that more
or reduce the penalty
or maybe it really is...you need the right run through 

how you feeling: "keep dying"
"slightly frustrated"
"not much of a gamer"
^ feeling like this is a reflection of your ability?
^ could have asked what he meant by that ok ok . 

^ what did you mean, not much of a gamer?

ah he's trying to run...
pursue

22...HMMMMM
"this is difficult"

24:30 my only strat is run back to the door
other than that...not really sure what my strat would be, just going blind rn

damn this is like actually a tough problem...

i do wanna play it myself, see what they are seeing with my own hands and eyes

26:30 oh there *is* fuel on this map - maybe the page refreshed or something though 

the flame balls can attack up close, maybe the mushrooms just cannot 

28:30 - going for the level up
29:30 i wanna burn less fuel and not dy
and also sheilding...

v concerned about dying to enemies and fuel
i mean those *are* the obstacles, but he's playing v defensively bc he feels he has to 

AH! use the fuel cell icon AS the icon next to the meeter
good visual que, couldn't be that hard to set up

31:00 has a sheild on, somehow
^ relates to one of the charms that he uses?
^ it's not coming off...
i think pat had this bug as well
ok so there is a pause period before you start draining health

the game is pretty hard
not sure if my ability or game is hard
even if i survive i keep running out of fuel

the UI
not quite familiar to me...
seems turn based...it was a little weird
didn't know how to attack
didn't know that i had to run into them 

gamer...
my brother is a gamer
3-4x a week
seems like he' plays all day 

he's here to skill up 

i had a shortcut key to go into inventory and talents
i knew that from the debug screen
without that i would have been confused 

some other game might have figured it out 

preference for keys rather than mouse 

i and t will close that

i liked visual armor, it was cute
i liked the running 
"if there was the fuel limit, i would have kept exploring"

"i'm super directionless"
"i kept getting lost, i need to wander a lot to find my way"

i didn't know this, but he had played the game prior, so he had some prior knowledge, perhaps this further emphasizes his points.

noted that he started moving immediately, didn't take any time to poke around the HUD

# ux research techniques
use a recorder, rather than notes
- enable push to talk
- keep yourself on mute and talk into a recorder
- then otter it

# observations
- he uses both the arrows and the keys
- he didn't seem to know that you can use scan to spot traps
	- died to a lot of traps
- he died quite a lot
	- cheifly to fuel deaths
- possible balance issue with the fuel
	- sometimes you spawn with a tank, but sometimes you don't
	- if you don't happen upon one, you are totally screwed
- he said that he felt slightly frustrated because he kept dying
	- at one point sighed audibly and chuckled 
		- "hmmmmm...this is hard"
	- attributed this to his ability 
		- says he's not much of a gamer

# suggestions
- make fuel deaths less opaque
	- put the fuel tank icon to the left of the fuel gauge
	- perhaps have that gauge blink yellow and white @ 25%
- reduce possibility of fuel death suggestions
	- increase fuel drops
	- reduce/change the penalty

# time stamps
- 9:40 - opens talents for first time 
- 15:21 - weird teleport bug
